<h1><code>ABOUT</code></h1>
<hr><hr>
<p><code>The story of <i><b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b></i> primarily begins in
2000 with the <q>Second Impact</q>, a global cataclysm which almost completely
destroyed Antarctica and led to the deaths of half human population of Earth.
The Impact is believed by the public at large and even most of NERV to have
been the impact of a meteorite landing in Antarctica, causing devastating
tsunamis and a change in the Earth's axial tilt &#40;leading to global climate
change&#41; and subsequent geopolitical unrest, nuclear war &#40;such as the
nuking of Tokyo Japan&#41;, and general economic distress. Later, Second Impact
is revealed to be the result of contact with and experimentation on the first
of what are collectively dubbed the Angels&#58; Adam. The experiments were
sponsored by the mysterious organization SEELE, and carried out by the research
organization Gehirn.</code>
