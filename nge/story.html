<code><i>Evangelion</i> is an apocalyptic anime, set in futuristic Tokyo
fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm. The story centers on <b>Shinji</b>,
a teenage boy who is recruited by his father into the shadowy organization NERV
to pilot a giant bio&#45;machine mecha called an Evangelion in combat against
monstrous beings known as Angels. The series explores the experiences and
emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of NERV as they attempt to prevent
another catastrophe. In the series&#44; there are many references to
psychoanalytic concepts&#44; such as the oral stage&#44; introjection&#44; oral
personality&#44; ambivalence&#44; and the death drive.  In particular&#44; the
series references elements of the works of Sigmund Freud&#44; Jacques
Lacan&#44; Arthur Schopenhauer&#44; Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#44;
Jean&#45;Paul Sartre and others. It features religious symbolism throughout the
series&#44; including themes and imagery derived from Kabbalah&#44;
Christianity&#44; Judaism&#44; Buddhism&#44; and Shinto.</code>
