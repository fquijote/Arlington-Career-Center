      <h1>Journal Week 4</h1>
      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start studying for CIW Lesson 4 quiz. Will strategize a plan to finish a lesson every fifth day, or day 5, of a single journal from now on.</li>
        <li>Helped Edson Equinteros revise his custom homepage project, specifically misspellings, and fix the mechanics of his table, <code>nav</code> element.</li>
      </ul>  
      <h2>Day 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spent the whole class helping Edson Equinteros format Katherine Johnson's name, caption, and image. Had a hard time moving the image right next to caption.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Day 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Helped Edson Equinteros change background-cover with a lightened opactity to reveal the text easier. Also tried to figure out the dimensions of normal paper with the Katherine Johnson page</li>
        <li>Afterwards, I studied the needed information for CIW Lesson 4 quiz</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Day 4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mainly studied on CIW Lesson 4&#58; &#34;Using Advanced CSS3 Techniques&#34;.</li>
        <li>Focused on the objectives of&#58; 2D and 3D transformations, applying transitions and animations, creating accessible user interfaces, creating menus and buttons, and create transparencies and overlays all with CSS3.<li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Day 5</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CIW Lesson 4 information learned&#58;</li>
        <li>The Z&#45;axis is needed to provide coordinates in three&#45;dimensional space to create a plane to help orient a 3D object.</li>
        <li>CSS3 3D transformations allow you to format your elements in CSS3 using three-dimensional effects.</li>
        <li>The CSS3 &#34;translate&#34; method is available in both 2D and 3D transforms and is used to move an element from its current position, based on specified parameters.</li>
        <li>Transformations, or &#34;transforms&#34; as they are sometimes called in CSS, use the CSS3 transform properties to allow elements to rotate, move, flip and stretch.</li>
        <li>You must identify the CSS property to add the transition, then define the duration of the effect. If you do not specify a duration, then no transition will occur.</li>
        <li>CSS3 2D transformations allow you to format your elements using a flat, two-dimensional effect. The transformation parameters are defined by methods. The matrix&#40;n,n,n,n,n,n&#41; method combines all of the 2D transform methods into one, which enables an element to rotate, scale, move &#40;translate&#41; and skew.</li>
        <li>The W3C defines a transform as an effect that changes an elements shape, size and/or position.</li>
        <li>Transition is a CSS3 effect that gradually changes an element from one style to another style. Transitions are usually triggered when an element, such as an image or text box, is selected or hovered over by the end user. When the user removes the cursor from the element, the element changes back to its original style.</li>
        <li>The CSS3 scale method is available in both 2D and 3D transforms and is used to increase or decrease the size of an element, based on specified parameters.</li>
      </ul>
