    <h1>Special Characters</h1>
    <p>Since &lt; &gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have less than sign appear in your document, you need to use <code>&amp;lt;</code> to represent it.</p>
